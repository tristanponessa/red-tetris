i still have to do npx jest 
instead of yarn jest why?

# to launch project 
 ! have to launch everytime a new terminal loads
    NVM node version manager [bypasses sudo]
    touch ~/.bash_profile
    8  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
    source ~/.bash_profile
   11  nvm install 16
   node -v 

   

    0.1. 
    1.npm install --global yarn\ [to avoid npm install yarn that generates a package.lock along with yarn.lock which is nt recommended by yarn]
    2.npx yarn install\
    3.npx jest 
    4.npx yarn start
    (options ot trigger babel js version? ts version?)

VSC extenSIONS:


DEPENDENCIES:

    BABEL vs TS 
    both transpilors 
    were gonna TS for type support 

    webpack: 
    babel : [does react continue using it?]
    typescript:

    ts-jest:    in order for ts and jestto work together [does it install jest and ts alone?]
    yarn add --dev @types/jest   to test types and pure ts func

-check if everything works properly , and not ignore any features like between wepback ts or ts react ect....



REACT AND TYPESCRIPT 


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
